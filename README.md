3Sp summer 2025 Hydroponics project 
This project reuses wooden pallets and recycled materials to create mobile hydroponic units that work to provide food to the community in the most efficient way. Going off of the findings from summer of 2024, the team is looking to implement the right amount of nutrition and essentials to the system to grow the healthiest plants. 
The module runs on a sensor-based monitoring system that checks the values for the reservoir's conditions as well as the environment's.
