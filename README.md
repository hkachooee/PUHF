# PUHF 3SP Summer 2025 Pop-UP Hydroponic Farms project 
This project reuses wooden pallets and recycled materials to create mobile hydroponic units that work to provide food to the community in the most efficient way. Going off of the findings from summer of 2024, the team is looking to implement the right amount of nutrition and essentials to the system to grow the healthiest plants. The stack utilizes Deep Flow Technique (Hydroponic system), unique pumping system, full spectrum LEDS, free servers, simple electrical components, and open-source software. 
The module runs on an automated sensor-based monitoring system, called the "Farm Brain", that checks the values for the reservoir's conditions as well as the environment's. The Farm Brain holds 3 local servers, 2 cloud services, alerting system, multivolt circuit, and a Raspberry Pi based network.
